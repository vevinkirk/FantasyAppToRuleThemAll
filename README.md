The Fantasy App to Rule Them All

## Requirements

* Framework

## Technologies

**Frontend framework**

Pricing is relatively hidden on these sites, so it's tough to get an estimate for each one.

* [SportsData](https://sportsdata.io/developers/getting-started) [ data comes scrambled ]
* [Yahoo Api](https://developer.yahoo.com/fantasysports/guide/) 
* [Sportradar](https://developer.sportradar.com/)

**Other thoughts**

May be nice just to use something like material UI.
